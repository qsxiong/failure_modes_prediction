#this study explored out a novel strategy by allocating principle component analysis (PCA) for 
#experimental data mining and feature extraction, which was proved a powerful capability of enhancing 
#the prediction accuracy compared with training with raw data. Based on the assembled dataset consisting
#of 181 RC shear walls by this study, nine classical and state-of-the-art ML algorithms were investigated,
#among which gradient boosting classifier achieved a relevantly high accuracy of 0.98 after performed with hyperparameter optimization.
